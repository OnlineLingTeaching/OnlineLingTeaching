# Using Zoom with an iPad

If you have an iPad you can use the iPad with Zoom as a whiteboard.

## Method  A (using an existing iPad app).

 1. Start a Zoom meeting on your Mac  (you can double click on your personal meeting ID and then choose start.
 2. Choose New Share from within the  meeting, and choose "Share iPad via Airplay". The first time you do this  it may install a plugin automatically first.
 3. On your iPad make the  Control Center (or whatever it's called, the little set of icons that  you pull down from the top right corner of the screen) and turn on  Screen Mirroring. This will give you a little dropdown menu and your  Mac's name+Zoom should appear. Once you've done that, you should be all  set. Then you can use either any on your iPad. I use Notability, and  just draw everything there.

## Method B (using the Zoom  whiteboard):

 1. Login to the same meeting on both your iPad and your Mac.  Make sure that the audio is completely off on the iPad (assuming you're  using the computer audio).
 2. On the iPad, choose New Share and then  Whiteboard. This will allow you to use the built-in whiteboard function.  Not as nice as using an app in your iPad directly, but it will  certainly do the trick.
