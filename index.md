# Welcome
This site is designed to collect useful How-tos for Linguists teaching online.
It arose out of the very useful, but hard to search Facebook group [Online Linguistics Teaching: Tips and Tricks](https://www.facebook.com/groups/551898862199586/) created by [David Pesetsky](https://linguistics.mit.edu/user/pesetsk/).

Although the site is a static site and does not include the dynamic aspect of the comments in the Facebook group, it should allow people to find information much more easily than on the Facebook group.

Ideally the information here should be self-contained. There are other sites that have collected links to things like specific teaching materials. This site is designed to focus mainly on "How to" information, practical instructions for getting things done.

I envision this site as a collaborative effort, and welcome people who would like to add content. Site pages are written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) which makes adding new content easy for anyone (no coding skills required). The site is managed through a GitHub repository, so it helps if you are familiar with using Git in some way.
